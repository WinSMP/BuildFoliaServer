# BuildFoliaServer

> Don't wanna compile Folia? Here you go: automated builds!

This repo includes:
- Bash script to compile Folia on an [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) install, preferably a Docker [container](https://hub.docker.com/_/archlinux).
- Weekly builds (every Tuesday, 3 AM UTC) compiling the latest commit from [upstream](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia), published in releases automatically.
